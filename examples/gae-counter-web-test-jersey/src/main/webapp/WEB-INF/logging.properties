# Global logging properties. 
# ------------------------------------------ 
# The set of handlers to be loaded upon startup. 
# Comma-separated list of class names. 
# (? LogManager docs say no comma here, but JDK example has comma.) 
# Specify the handlers to create in the root logger
# (all loggers are children of the root logger)
#handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Default global logging level. 
# Loggers and Handlers may override this level 
.level = INFO
    
# Handlers 
# -----------------------------------------

# --- ConsoleHandler --- 
# Override of global logging level 
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=INFO


# Loggers 
# ------------------------------------------ 
# Loggers are usually attached to packages. 
# Here, the level for each package is specified. 
# The global level is used by default, so levels 
# specified here simply act as an override.
